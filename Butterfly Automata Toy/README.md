Automata Butterfly Toy

The project that I chose is an Automata Butterfly Toy which flaps its wings and moves back and forth when the crank is turned. When you turn the crank, the wheels rotate periodically which causes the connecting rods to touch the wings and make the butterfly to flutter its wings . I divided the mechanism into the next components:
- the box
- the butterfly
- the crank
- 3 disks/wheels
- 3 connecting rods
